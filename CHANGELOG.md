## v2.9.1 / 2023-05-29

This release does not incorporate any user-facing changes. Re-running release procedures as the process for the previous release failed. Changes are listed in v2.9.0.

## v2.9.0 / 2023-05-23

The changes mentioned below are only the user-facing ones. For a list of the complete set of changes, refer the changelog associated with the release tag.

**Note:**

* The deprecated experimental VerticalPodAutoscaler metrics are no longer supported, and have been removed. We recommend to use CustomResourceState metrics to gather metrics from custom resources like the Vertical Pod Autoscaler.
* #2004 regulated label names to adhere with [OTel-Prometheus standards](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/8946dfc6a2302f78b0224fcc3f4dfb816a7bb1f4/specification/compatibility/prometheus_and_openmetrics.md?plain=1#L224-L229), so existing label names that do not follow the same may be replaced by the ones that do. Please refer to the PR for more details.

## v2.8.0 / 2023-02-10

Note: The `--version` flag was removed as `kube-state-metrics version` also provides the same information. See #1956

Note: Experimental CustomResourceState changed their labels for better usability. See #1942
kube_crd_uptime{group="myteam.io", kind="Foo", version="v1"} -> kube_customresource_uptime{customresource_group="myteam.io", customresource_kind="Foo", customresource_version="v1"}

## v2.7.0 / 2022-11-25

Note: Experimental VerticalPodAutoscaler metrics are considered deprecated in this release and will be removed in v2.9.0.
Please use CustomResourceStateMetrics to gather metrics from VPA resources. See: #1718

Note: Experimental CustomResourceState changed their naming convention for better usability.
The name of the CRD used to be interpolated into the name of the metric which made it impossible to aggregate a CRD across different versions.
This was changed to have the GVK information represented as labels:
kube_myteam_io_v1_Foo_uptime -> kube_crd_uptime{group="myteam.io", kind="Foo", version="v1"}
